# GitHub Pages Setup Instructions

## ðŸš¨ IMPORTANT: GitHub Pages needs to be enabled manually

The website code is ready and deployed, but GitHub Pages needs to be enabled in the repository settings.

## Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Enable GitHub Pages

1. **Go to Repository Settings**
   - Visit: https://github.com/half-tech-circle/half-tech-circle/settings
   - Scroll down to "Pages" section

2. **Configure Pages Source**
   - Source: Select **"GitHub Actions"** 
   - Do NOT select "Deploy from branch"

3. **Save Settings**
   - Click "Save" 
   - The workflow will automatically trigger

### 2. Verify Deployment

1. **Check Actions Tab**
   - Go to: https://github.com/half-tech-circle/half-tech-circle/actions
   - Look for "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow
   - Should see it running or completed

2. **Access Website**
   - URL: https://half-tech-circle.github.io/
   - May take 2-5 minutes to become available

### 3. Troubleshooting

#### If GitHub Actions don't run:
```bash
# Trigger workflow manually
gh workflow run deploy.yml --repo half-tech-circle/half-tech-circle
```

#### If 404 errors persist:
1. Check that GitHub Pages source is set to "GitHub Actions"
2. Verify workflow completed successfully
3. Wait 5-10 minutes for DNS propagation

#### If build fails:
1. Check Actions logs for errors
2. Common issues:
   - Missing Node.js permissions
   - Package installation failures
   - Build configuration errors

### 4. Post-Setup Verification

Once enabled, verify these URLs work:
- âœ… https://half-tech-circle.github.io/ (Homepage)
- âœ… https://half-tech-circle.github.io/en/ (English homepage)
- âœ… https://half-tech-circle.github.io/books/ (Books page)
- âœ… https://half-tech-circle.github.io/blog/ (Blog page)
- âœ… https://half-tech-circle.github.io/members/ (Members page)
- âœ… https://half-tech-circle.github.io/contact/ (Contact page)

## Why Manual Setup is Required

GitHub requires manual enablement of Pages for security reasons:
- Prevents accidental public deployments
- Allows repository owners to control access
- Ensures proper permissions are set

## After Setup

Once GitHub Pages is enabled:
- **Automatic Deployments**: Every push to `main` triggers deployment
- **Fast Updates**: Changes go live in 2-5 minutes
- **Status Monitoring**: Check Actions tab for deployment status
- **No Manual Work**: Everything else is automated
